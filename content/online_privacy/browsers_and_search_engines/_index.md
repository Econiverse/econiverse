title: Browsers and Search Engines

Since web browsers and search engines can see everything that you visit or search,
it is important that that focus on privacy. Here are a few that do.

## Web browsers
To start, [test](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/) your browser here to see how
well it is defending you against trackers.

### Brave
The [Brave browser](https://brave.com/) is a fast, private, and secure web browser for PC, Mac/Linux
and mobile that provides an ad-free browsing experience that saves data and
battery life by blocking tracking software.

In addition to the built in protection from Brave, it is recommended to install
[uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) which is a wide-spectrum content blocker.

### Tor
If privacy and anonymity are of upmost importance, consider using the
[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/). Tor defends against tracking,
surveillance, and allows users to circumvent censorship.

## Search engines

### DuckDuckGo
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is a search engine that does not track its
users or personalize search results. This means that the same results are shown
for a given search term and visitors are not profiled. Tor uses DuckDuckGo as
its primary search engine.
