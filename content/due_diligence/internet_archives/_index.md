There are many ways to access information on the internet when the original is
removed. These resources can also be used to archive content that you create
or find interesting.

{{< hint info >}}
When archiving a website, watch out for tracking information in the URL.
Tracking information starts with a ? and contains everything that follows
(ex. www.reddit.com/mypost?utm_source=share). A link with tracking Information
 and a link without tracking information will be saved as two separate websites.
 More information on URL tracking can be found [here](https://www.leadsquared.com/what-is-a-tracking-url/).

## archive.today
One way to do this is by using [archive.today](https://archive.ph/)[.onion](http://archiveiya74codqgiixo33q62qlrqtkgmcitqx5u2oeqnmn5bpcbiyd.onion/).
They also provide an extension that works with Brave browser and it allows you
to easily archive pages with the click of a button.

## Ghostarchive
[Ghostarchive](https://ghostarchive.org/) is a web archiving website and platform. It is designed to be fast, versatile, and easy to use. A open source release is planned soon.

## Reveddit
To recover information that has been removed from Reddit, replace "reddit" in the
URL with "reveddit". [Reveddit](https://www.reveddit.com/about/) actively monitors
reddit and archives posts and comments that are removed.
