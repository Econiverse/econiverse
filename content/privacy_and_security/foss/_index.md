Free open source software is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. This website is an example of FOSS! If you'd like
to read the license it can be found [here](https://github.com/Econiverse/econiverse/blob/main/LICENSE).

One major benefit of FOSS is it's code is available for anyone to review. This
results in the largest, trusted projects being some of the most secure software
available.

## Linux
Linux is a FOSS operating system, similar to Windows, but considered superior in
regards to privacy, security, performance, and reliability. Since the code is
available with the freedom to modify, there have been many branches that have
developed over time. Here is a non-extensive map as an example:

For most users, Ubuntu is recommended as the flavor to use. Ubuntu provides long
term support with five years of security patches and updates. Installation is
relevantly easy and a guide on how to install Ubuntu along side Windows can
 be found [here](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/).

## LibreOffice
LibreOffice is a FOSS office suite that includes a word processor, spreadsheet,
presentation, database, and more. It is included in the recommended software
that is optional while installing Ubuntu and can also be found [here](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/).

## 7-Zip
[7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/) is a file archiver with a high compression ratio.
