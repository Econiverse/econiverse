Since web browsers and search engines can see everything that you visit or search, it is important that that focus on privacy. Here are a few that do.

## Web browsers
To start, [test](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/) your browser here to see how well it is defending you against trackers.

### Brave
The [Brave browser](https://brave.com/) is a fast, private, and secure web browser for PC, Mac/Linux and mobile that provides an ad-free browsing experience that saves data and battery life by blocking tracking software.

In addition to the built in protection from Brave, it is recommended to install [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) which is a wide-spectrum content blocker.

### Firefox
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) has no shady privacy policies or back doors for advertisers. Just a lightning fast browser that doesnâ€™t sell you out.

{{< hint info >}}
It is recommended to change some of the default settings with Firefox to increase privacy and block tracking. A good overview can be found [here](https://www.quippd.com/writing/2021/07/26/firefox-privacy-stop-hardening-love-strict-etp.html).

### Tor
If privacy and anonymity are of upmost importance, consider using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/). Tor defends against tracking, surveillance, and allows users to circumvent censorship.

## Search engines

### DuckDuckGo
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is a search engine that does not track its users or personalize search results. This means that the same results are shown for a given search term and visitors are not profiled. Tor uses DuckDuckGo as its primary search engine.
