Econiverse is a free and open source website that was created
as a compilation of free knowledge, educational sources, and resources for those
who wish to learn more about finance. The pages are intended to provide detailed
information that is easily digestible. You shouldn't have to pay anything to
learn about finance and this resource provides a way to do that!

While Econiverse was inspired from the misinformation and widespread financial fraud that beagan to be exposed in 2021 due to GameStop stock, it is not
 restricted to it! If you can [contribute](/help_build_econiverse/) directly, please do! Or, if you have any ideas or notice anything that needs correcting, please submit a [issue](https://github.com/Econiverse/econiverse/issues) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/Econiverse/econiverse/discussions).
