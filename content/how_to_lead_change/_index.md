### Escalation to the Office of Ombudsman
Ombudsman institutions protect people from maladministration and violation of their rights in more than 100 countries worldwide. The Ombudsman promotes fairness, accountability and transparency in the public sector by investigating public complaints and systemic issues within their jurisdiction. The Ombudsman Act sets out the Ombudsman’s powers of investigation, which include the authority to issue summonses, request documentation from public sector bodies, require evidence under oath, and inspect premises. It is an offence under the Ombudsman Act to mislead the Ombudsman or to obstruct an Ombudsman investigation. Government (regulated) organizations must co-operate with the Ombudsman’s investigations.

If your complaint with your broker or FINRA is not resolved to your full satisfaction, you can easily escalate it to the Ombudsman. You can hold your broker accountable, and ensure they action your requests in a timely manner. Brokers must provide you with the information on how to escalate further, but generally try to avoid this happening at all costs as they do not want unresolved complaints escalated. Take a look at the annual escalations that actually make it to the Ombudsman.

### Your Broker's Compliance Department
Lodge an official complaint with your broker's compliance department:
Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) Issues on transfer? Margin calls without having a margin account? Questionable activity around your GME holdings? Refusal or delay in DRS transfer requests?

Brokers typically make every effort to resolve your concerns when you lodge an official complaint as they become a matter of public record. For official complaints, they must action and respond quickly, and if you are not satisfied with full resolution of your complaint you can escalate to the FINRA, the SEC and the Ombudsman.

### DRS Transfer issues and an escalation resource
Legally, your broker must still EXPEDITE your transfer request to Computershare, even though Computershare is not a broker and does not fall under the ACATS 3-day rules. You should not have to transfer between brokers only to transfer to Computershare. You can hold your broker accountable through FINRA Rule 11870 (2) by lodging an official complaint, and escalating to the Ombudsman if they do not resolve your complaint in a timely manner.

From the FINRA website: FINRA regulations for broker to broker transfers and non ACATS transfer requests:

https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/11870

(2) If a customer desires to transfer a portion of his or her account outside of the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS), authorized alternate instructions should be transmitted to the carrying member indicating such intent and specifying the designated assets to be transferred. Although such transfers are not subject to the provisions of this Rule, members must expedite all authorized account asset transfers***, whether through ACATS or via other means permissible*** under this Rule, and coordinate their activities with respect thereto.

### Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Title 5 of the United States Code, section 552, provides that any person has the right to request access to Federal agency records or information.
