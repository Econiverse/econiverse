Most companies, such as Gmail, only encrypt communications when they are
en-route to their companies servers. Once the information arrives at their servers,
the information is decrypted and the service provider can see the contents.
End-to-end encryption keeps your communication encrypted until is arrives at
the recipient and is then decrypted. This means that governments, service providers,
and hackers are unable to view the contents of your emails. Here are some free email
services that provide end-to-end encryption:
