Automated trading based on rules that are derived from technical analysis
(creating a trading bot) is not a novel concept but traditionally has not been
available to the average investor. With cryptocurrency however, this concept
is more widely available through Application Programming Interfaces
([APIs](https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/)) and tools such
as:


 1. [Cryptohopper](https://www.cryptohopper.com/)
 2. [3Commas](https://3commas.io/)
 3. [Maker Dao](https://docs.makerdao.com/keepers/market-maker-keepers/market-maker-keeper-bot-setup-guide)
 4. [Hummingbot](https://hummingbot.io/)
