## Signal

Signal is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted messaging and calling app. This feature ensures that only the parties involved in the communication can read the messages or listen to the calls. With Signal, privacy isn't optional - it's intrinsic. You can learn more about Signal on their [official website](https://www.signal.org/).

## Removing Bloatware on Samsung Phones

By using your computer, you can remove pre-installed apps, known as bloatware, that are typically difficult to uninstall via the Android interface. A comprehensive guide for removing Bixby can be found [here](https://darpan.blog/code/guide-remove-bixby-bloatware-from-samsung-galaxy-phones/#Steps_to_remove_Bixby_from_Samsung_Galaxy_phones).

## App Permissions

It's advisable to periodically review the app permissions granted on your device. You might unknowingly allow permissions to cameras, microphones, contacts, etc., to apps that don't necessarily require them. AVG provides a useful [guide](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/guide-to-android-app-permissions-how-to-use-them-smartly) for managing these permissions. Please note that while AVG's software is promoted in the guide, its use is a matter of personal preference and is not endorsed here.
