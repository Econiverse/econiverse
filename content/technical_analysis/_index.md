Technical Analysis (TA) in financial markets draws on historical data to anticipate future investment trends. It considers how factors like price changes, the amount of trading activity, the general mood of the market, and indicators of economic health can sway buying or selling decisions.

Essential TA tools encompass chart patterns that signal potential price changes, oscillators that gauge market conditions, and moving averages that reveal price trends. Using these tools collectively offers a more coherent view of the market's possible direction, aiding in more informed investment decisions.
