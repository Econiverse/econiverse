## Cash Account

### Buying with Cash Account:

With a Cash Account, the Investor (in this example the investor being you) would deposit money into the account you have opened up with your Broker. Let’s presume you despot $100 into you Cash account. You would now have $100 “Buying Power”. Should the investor wish to buy a certain security/stock the investor must have the cash available in the brokerage account equal to the total cost.

Example; Company ABC is trading at $50 per share and you wish to purchase two shares – You would need to have $100 (2 Shares @$50 each) available in your cash account.

Depending on your brokerage, you may need to pay a fee also known as commission to your Broker to submit and exercise this trade on your behalf. This fee/commission needs to be paid with the overall transaction to exercise your trade.

If we use the above example; Company ABC is trading at $50 per share and you wish to purchase two shares, your Broker has a fee of $10 per trade – You would need to have $110 (2 Shares @$50 each = $100 + $10 fee for broker) in your Cash Account for this trade to be valid and submitted and be filled.

### Selling with a Cash Account:

Following on from the above example, two weeks passed and Company ABC is now trading at $60 per share. You wish to sell or exit your position. You’d put in a sell order through your broker to sell your two shares. In this example at $60 each. Once the sell order is executed, you’d have to wait T+2 Days (where is Transaction day + 2 BUSINESS days), once this T+2 period passes the $120 will be reflected in your cash account usually as ’Buying Power’. Until the trade settles, you can't withdraw the money from your brokerage account or use it to make anther purchase.



## Margin Account

A Margin Account allows an investor to borrow against the dollar value of the assets (Cash and/or Securities/shares can be assets) in the account. Investors can use margin accounts to leverage their positions. What does margin and leverage mean? Margin is basically another word for loan/borrow and Leverage is a fancy word for advantage (in your favour).

Leverage is usually a ratio of sorts (2:1, 4:1, 10:1 or 20:1 for example). In the examples we will use a leverage ratio of 2:1, meaning for every dollar of value you have in your account, your broker is willing to let you borrow two dollars – another way to think of it is; for every dollar you have in your brokerage account your broker is willing to loan you two dollars. So let’s presume your margin account has $5,000 in it, your broker is willing to lend $10,000 you OR allow you to borrow $10,000 – as that will be a 2:1 ratio.

Now, with every loan you take there is interest, and this loan is no different. Your Broker will advise you of the interest rate – usually a percentage (%) – for the Margin account to which you are required to pay, basically a fee for using their funds.

## Example of both Cash and Margin side-by-side where stock goes up:

For example, presume both Cash and Margin Accounts have $5,000 deposited with the Margin given a leverage of 2:1. Additionally the broker has no fee/commission to factor in.

Week 1 BUYING - Company ABC is trading at $200 per share

Week 2 – SELLING Company ABC trading at $300 per share

### Week 1
Cash Account (Week 1)

$5,000 allows the Investor to buy 25 Shares at $200 per share.

Margin Account (Week 1)

$10,000 allows the investor to buy 50 shares at $200 per share.

So you can see from the above example that both accounts had the same $5,000 deposited to use, the Cash account ended up with 25 Shares while the Margin account still with $5,000 deposited but leveraged 2:1 through their broker ended up with 50 shares.

Now let’s fast forward a week and sell our shares.

### Week 2
Cash Account (Week 2)

Selling 25 shares at $300 per share would equate to $7,500. After T+2 Days you’d have available $7,500 to trade with or withdraw from your brokerage account to say buy yourself something nice.

Margin Account (Week 2)

Selling 50 shares at $300 per share would equate to $15,000 and your buying powers would available immediately avoiding the T+2 waiting period.
