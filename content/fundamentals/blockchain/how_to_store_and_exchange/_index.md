There are a few ways to obtain cryptocurrency. The most popular method is to exchange
a fiat currency for it, such as the United States Dollar, or to exchange other
cryptocurrencies for it, such as Bitcoin. This exchange of one store of value for another is done on an - exchange. There are two types of exchanges, centralized and
decentralized.

## How to Exchange

### Centralized Exchange

Centralized exchanges utilize an internal closed system in order to match trades.
They operate for profit and are usually very user friendly. Centralized exchanges
are where most people begin with purchasing cryptocurrency.

Since centralized exchanges hold the private keys to your cryptocurrency, you do not
technically own them - the exchange does. Because of this, it is very important to
trust the exchange that you use.

Some popular centralized exchanges are:

1. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en)
2. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)
3. [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
4. [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)
5. [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/)



### Decentralized exchange

Decentralized exchanges utilize a peer to peer system and smart contracts in order
to match orders. Since there is no central entity, the government cannot track
transactions or forcefully impose taxes and regulations. With decentralized exchanges,
you hold your private keys, and thus, the ability to spend your cryptocurrency
without relying on a central entity. You must have a wallet to use a decentralized exchange.

Some popular decentralized exchanges are:

1. [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
2. [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/)
3. [MDEX](https://mdex.co/#/)
4. [1Inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/swap)

## How to Store

### Software Wallets

Each blockchain offers a way to hold the asset that is specific to that chain. These are commonly called wallets and may be offered by the same team that has built the chain or by a 3rd party. For example, a list of Bitcoin wallets can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).

Some cryptocurrencies are built on top of an existing blockchain and use the same wallet that the blockchain does. For example, [Dai](https://makerdao.com/en/) is a stable coin built on Ethereum and can be held in any [ETH Wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/).

### Hardware Wallets

While software wallets are convenient to use and easily integrate with websites or apps, they are considered one of the less secure options since they are connected to the internet. To mitigate this risk, some users prefer to use a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are physical devices that typically connect over USB to a computer. Some examples of hardware wallets are:

1. [Ledger](https://shop.ledger.com/)
2. [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)
3. [KeepKey](https://shapeshift.com/keepkey)

### Paper Wallets

For people with large holdings or those who want a different medium to store their digital currency, paper wallets offer a more traditional solution. They are just that - the unique code that allows you to move cryptocurrency from that wallet is printed out on paper. When you want to make a transaction, the QR code must be scanned.
