To edit a page thorough a web browser, first navigate to the page that you would like to edit and
then click the "Edit this page" button at the top right of the page.

This will then bring you to the GitHub repo and you will be shown the file that contains the page
you wish to edit. To edit the page, click the "Edit this file" button in the top right. If you do not have a GitHub account, create one at the log in prompt.
