Most companies, such as Gmail, only encrypt communications when they are en-route to their servers. However, once the information arrives at their servers, it is decrypted, and the service provider can see the contents. End-to-end encryption, on the other hand, keeps your communication encrypted until it arrives at the recipient and is then decrypted. This means that governments, service providers, and hackers are unable to view the contents of your emails. Here are some free email services that provide end-to-end encryption:
