Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a group of financial applications that are hosted
on public blockchains that offer peer to peer services which traditionally have
only been available through banks. This includes borrowing, lending, and trading
directly with a peer without a central entity. This is made possible through the
use of [Smart Contracts](https://www.inve.stopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp).

Some examples of DeFi include:

1. [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/)
2. [AAVE](https://aave.com/)
3. [Compound](https://compound.finance/)
4. [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/)
