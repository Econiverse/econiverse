In the ever-changing landscape of the internet, content can quickly become inaccessible. Whether it's because the original has been removed or the website no longer exists, there are still ways to access this lost information. What's more, these resources can also be utilized to archive the content that you've created or found intriguing.

{{< hint info >}}
Please be mindful when archiving a webpage: it's important to pay attention to URL tracking information, which typically commences with a "?". This part of the URL and everything following it (e.g., www.reddit.com/mypost?utm_source=share) is seen as unique. Consequently, a URL containing tracking information and a URL without such information would be archived as distinct entities. For further understanding of URL tracking, visit this [link](https://www.leadsquared.com/what-is-a-tracking-url/).

## archive.today
One effective approach is to use [archive.today](https://archive.ph/) [(.onion)](http://archiveiya74codqgiixo33q62qlrqtkgmcitqx5u2oeqnmn5bpcbiyd.onion/). As an added benefit, they provide a Brave browser extension, making page archiving as simple as a mouse click.
