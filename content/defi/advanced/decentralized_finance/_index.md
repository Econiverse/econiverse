Title: Introduction to Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
---

Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a set of financial applications hosted on public blockchains that offer peer-to-peer services traditionally provided by banks. These services include borrowing, lending, trading, and more, all without the need for intermediaries. DeFi is made possible through the utilization of [Smart Contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp), which automate the execution and enforcement of agreements.

The DeFi ecosystem is continually evolving, and new projects emerge regularly. Here are some notable DeFi projects, listed in alphabetical order:
