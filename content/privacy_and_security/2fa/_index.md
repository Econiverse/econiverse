2FA, or two factor authentication, uses a second method in addition to a password to verify access. This means if your password is leaked or stolen, your account still cannot be accessed.

Common methods of accomplishing this are sending a code over a text message or email, using the same companies app on a mobile device, and timed based one time  passwords.

2FA is recommended where supported. For time based one time passwords, [Authy](https://authy.com/guides/twilio/) offers a solution that allows you to sync your 2FA accounts over multiple devices.
