An IP address is a unique digital location that is used to route data back and forth
between your device and the source of the data. This location is represented in
the form of numbers, such as [65.156.112.48]. Since this is a unique location, it can
be used to identify your physical location and track your activity across the
internet.

A VPN is a service that routes all traffic from your device to the VPN providers
servers, and then they use their IP address to send your data across the internet.
Thus, if anyone was to trace your activity on the internet, it would trace back
to your VPN provider.

In addition, since the information sent between your device
and your VPN provider is encrypted, your internet service provider will no
longer be able to view your activity.

If you use a VPN, your privacy is only as good as your VPN provider. The provider
may log your activity and then sell these to 3rd parties or hand them over to
governments. Be very weary of free VPN providers, since they all have to pay bills
somehow.

**General Recommendations**
1. Use a VPN - Pay for it
2. Do not use a VPN based in a country who is part of [Five Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes)
3. Use a provider who runs RAM-Only servers
4. Change your DNS service provider to a secure one like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/). You can test for DNS leaks [here](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/).
