## App Permissions

From time to time, it is recommended to review the app permissions you have granted
on your device. You may not be aware that you have granted apps permissions to
cameras, microphones, contacts, etc. that may not need them. AVG provides a good
guide for how to do this [here](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/guide-to-android-app-permissions-how-to-use-them-smartly) (they also promote their software in this guide, which is not endorsed and users should make their own decisions about using it).
