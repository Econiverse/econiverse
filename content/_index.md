# Welcome to Econiverse!

Econiverse is a community-driven, open-source platform dedicated to democratizing financial knowledge. Created by and for the people, it provides a suite of accessible, user-friendly, and free educational links and resources. The platform's mission is to equip individuals from all corners of the globe with the understanding they need to navigate the complexities of finance.

Econiverse originated amid the ever developing GameStop naked short selling saga, but goes beyond a single stock. Thanks to the collective efforts of the community, the platform is setup to continue to adapt to the ever changing financial landscape.

## Be a Part of the Mission
Econiverse would not be possible without the power of collective intelligence. The unique insights and perspectives each person have are critical to the growth of Econiverse. Therefore, an open invitation is always extended to anyone interested in [contributing](/help_build_econiverse/).

Whether you've spotted a mistake or have an innovative idea, your voice is welcome here. Engage with us! Start a conversation by posting an [issue](https://github.com/Econiverse/econiverse/issues) or initiating a [discussion](https://github.com/Econiverse/econiverse/discussions) on our GitHub page.

Let's decode the financial world together, creating an Econiverse that is inclusive and accessible to all.
