## Centralized Exchange

Centralized exchanges utilize an internal closed system in order to match trades.
They operate for profit and are usually very user friendly. Centralized exchanges
are where most people begin with purchasing cryptocurrency.

Since centralized exchanges hold the private keys to your cryptocurrency, you do not
technically own them - the exchange does. Because of this, it is very important to
trust the exchange that you use.

without relying on a central entity.
