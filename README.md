Econiverse is a free, non-monetized, community sourced open source website that was created as a place to collect knowledge, educational sources, and resources for those who wish to learn more about finance. The pages are intended to provide detailed information that is easily digestible. Financial knowledge and understanding should be accessible to everyone and this resource provides a stepping stone towards that!

The website can be found here: https://econiverse.github.io/

While Econiverse was inspired from the misinformation and widespread financial fraud exposed in 2021 due to GameStop stock, it is not restricted to it! If you can contribute directly, please do! Or, if you have any ideas or notice anything that needs correcting, please submit a issue or start a discussion.
