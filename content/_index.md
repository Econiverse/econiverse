Econiverse is a free and open source website that was created as a compilation of free knowledge, educational sources, and resources for those who wish to learn more about finance. The pages are intended to provide detailed information that is easily digestible. Financial knowledge should be accessible by everyone and this resource provides a way to do that!

While Econiverse was inspired from the misinformation and widespread financial fraud that began to be exposed in 2021 due to GameStop stock, it is not
 restricted to it! If you can [contribute](/help_build_econiverse/) directly, please do! Or, if you have any ideas or notice anything that needs correcting, please submit a [issue](https://github.com/Econiverse/econiverse/issues) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/Econiverse/econiverse/discussions).
