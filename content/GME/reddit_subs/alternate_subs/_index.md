"A foxhole for apes...but glorier!" This sub is a safe place for information ONLY. It is meant to be a smaller sub—for AMC/GME apes alike and whatever eventually comes after—that is less overwhelmed by chaos and noise than others. Think of it as an unofficial ape library. Remember those? Ideally, this sub will remain shill-free and and will also provide us with a solid, reliable place to share DD, research, news/media stories, and intel.

## [PickleFinancial](https://www.reddit.com/r/PickleFinancial/)

A place to focus on learning and discussing the stock market (as well as some quality shit-posting and meme'ing opportunities). Centered on the community around Gherkinit / Pickle Financial's Youtube channel and financial due diligence but open to all looking to learn. While much of the focus is on GameStop ($GME) currently, conversations about macroeconomic situations (minus the team-based political aspects) and due diligence for other stock tickers are also welcome.

## [tradespotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/tradespotting/)

The tradespotting subreddit

## [FWFBThinkTank](https://www.reddit.com/r/FWFBThinkTank/)

A community of wrinkle brain apes trying to piece together the greatest financial puzzle in history.

## [GMEdd.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEDD/)
