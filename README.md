Econiverse is a free and open source website that was created as a complication of free knowledge, educational sources, and resources for those who wish to learn more about finance. The pages are intended to provide detailed information that is easily digestible. You shouldnâ€™t have to pay anything to learn about finance and this resource provides a way to do that!

The website can be found here: https://econiverse.github.io/

While Econiverse was inspired from the misinformation and widespread financial fraud that began to be exposed in 2021 due to GameStop stock, it is not restricted to it!
