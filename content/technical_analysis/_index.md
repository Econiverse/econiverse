Technical Analysis (TA) is the study of past trading activity to predict future trading activity and opportunities. At its very core, TA is based on the human psychology of how price movements, along with other indicators, drive investors to buy or sell a security.

Technical traders follow things such as chart patterns, indicators, oscillators, support or resistance levels, moving averages, and more. When performing any form of TA, you should not rely on any one of these, but instead couple them together to draw a bigger picture, using multiple signals to confirm or reject any analysis you are performing.
